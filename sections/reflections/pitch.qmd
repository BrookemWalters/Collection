## Introduction

The perceived ease of my communications degree has long been ammunition for my self-deprecating humor. Now studying a quantitative field, I find myself navigating a dichotomy of self-doubt and relentless drive. However, it's time to lean into my liberal arts roots. This complementary combination of skills is my differentiator and is crucial in the data science landscape. After all, what value are analytical insights if they cannot be communicated effectively?

For this portfolio I will flex my marketing muscle to demonstrate practical application of statistical modeling and regression in a clear, concise, and visually engaging way.

## Elements

My portfolio's "brand theme" is inspired by femininity, philosophy and the art nouveau movement of the of the early 20^th^ century. Using these styling elements, my goal is to build several mini-interconnected projects utilizing R with a dash of [MySQL](https://services.gvsu.edu/TDClient/60/Portal/KB/?CategoryID=462) .

The assigned [reflections](https://brookemwalters.github.io/Collection/sections/reflections/reflections_main.html) are incorporated into this site to exercise and refine my writing skills alongside deepening my understanding of statistical modeling. I've chosen to use them as a platform to experiment with less conventional data visualizations, unbound by the professional constraints of my day job; a refreshing departure from the effective, yet monotonous, bar charts and tables that typically dominate the market intelligence reports I produce.

## Research Question

As for a topic, I'm still mulling that one over. I am inspired by the intersectionality of my hometown Grand Rapids' economic growth, the housing crisis, and the hellscape that is suburban spawl.
