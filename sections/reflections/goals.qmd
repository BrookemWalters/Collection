# **Goals**

### **Mission:**

-   Design a portfolio showcasing key skills sought after in the data science industry, such as SQL, A/B testing, and classification models.

-   Bridge the gap between my current resume and market demand, while demonstrating [STAT 631 course objectives](https://dykesb.netlify.app/courses/sta631/#course-objectives){target="_blank"}.\
    \

### **Project Objectives:**

-   Investigate the interplay between a municipality's [walkability index](https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B251AFDD9-23A7-4068-9B27-A3048A7E6012%7D){target="_blank"} (proximity and density of amenities) and various socio-economic factors within the Greater Grand Rapids Area by leveraging statistical modeling and data analysis techniques.

-   Elements

    My portfolio's "brand theme" is inspired by femininity, philosophy and the art nouveau movement of the early 20th century. Using these styling elements, my goal is to build several mini-interconnected projects demonstrating .

    The assigned reflections are incorporated into this site to exercise and refine my writing skills alongside deepening my understanding of statistical modeling. I've chosen to use them as a platform to experiment with less conventional data visualizations, unbound by the professional constraints of my day job; a refreshing departure from the effective, yet monotonous, bar charts and tables that typically dominate the market intelligence reports I produce.

\

-   Demonstrate data storytelling in a '[scannable](https://uxplanet.org/ux-design-practices-how-to-make-web-interface-scannable-2010125c710e){target="_blank"}' format guided by UX design principles. The focus will be on translating complex statistical results into business language that appeals to a corporate audience. The portfolio will be designed using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/){target="_blank"} and hosted on GitHub pages.
