# **Goals**

### **Mission:**

-   Design a portfolio showcasing key skills sought after in the data science industry, such as SQL, A/B Testing, and classification models.

-   Bridge the gap between my current resume and market demand, while demonstrating STAT 618 course objectives.\
    \

### **Project Objectives:**

-   Investigate the interplay between a municipality's [walkability index](https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B251AFDD9-23A7-4068-9B27-A3048A7E6012%7D){target="_blank"} (promiminty and density of amenities) and various socio-economic factors within the Greater Grand Rapids Area by leveraging statistical modeling and data analysis techniques.

-   Construct a SQL database integrating time-series data from reputable sources including but not limited to:

    -   [National Center for Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/recent-data.htm){target="_blank"}
    -   [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/recent-data.htm){target="_blank"}
    -   [Walkability Scores](https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/main/home.page;jsessionid=FFF65D9A779A543E6E84CC10BC78B7D3){target="_blank"}

\

-   Build and evaluate three different predictive models about the impact of a city's walkability on socio-economic parameters. Potential relationships to explore:

    -   Industries Growth Type and Walkability
    -   Walkability Scores and Average Life Expectancy
    -   Income Disparity and Walkability Scores\

-   Demonstrate data storytelling on Github pages in '[scannable](https://uxplanet.org/ux-design-practices-how-to-make-web-interface-scannable-2010125c710e){target="_blank"}' format guided by UX design principles. The focus will be on translating complex statistical results into business language that appeals to a corporate audience. The portfolio will be designed using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/){target="_blank"} and hosted on GitHub pages.
