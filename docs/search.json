Now studying a quantitative field, I find myself navigating a dichotomy of self-doubt and relentless drive. However, it’s time to lean into my liberal arts roots. This complementary combination of skills is my differentiator and is crucial in the data science landscape. After all, what value are analytical insights if they cannot be communicated effectively.\nFor this portfolio I will flex my marketing muscle to demonstrate practical application of statistical modeling and regression in a clear, concise, and visually engaging way."

Using these styling elements, my goal is to build several mini-interconnected projects utilizing R with a dash of MySQL .\nThe assigned reflections are incorporated into this site to exercise and refine my writing skills alongside deepening my understanding of statistical modeling. I’ve chosen to use them as a platform to experiment with less conventional data visualizations, unbound by the professional constraints of my day job; a refreshing departure from the effective, yet monotonous, bar charts and tables that typically dominate the market intelligence reports I produce."
