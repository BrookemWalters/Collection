Now studying a quantitative field, I find myself navigating a dichotomy of self-doubt and relentless drive. However, it’s time to lean into my liberal arts roots. This complementary combination of skills is my differentiator and is crucial in the data science landscape. After all, what value are analytical insights if they cannot be communicated effectively?\nFor this portfolio I will flex my marketing muscle to demonstrate practical application of statistical modeling and regression in a clear, concise, and visually engaging way."

I’ve chosen to use them as a platform to experiment with less conventional data visualizations, unbound by the professional constraints of my day job; a refreshing departure from the effective, yet monotonous, bar charts and tables that typically dominate the market intelligence reports I produce."

I have completed assignments and projects that required implementing these algorithms and analyzing their results.\nFor example, in my final project last semester in CIS 631, I conducted an analysis using multiple linear regression. The project focused on evaluating the relationship between crime rates and the presence of cannabis dispensaries while controlling for socioeconomic factors. I collected relevant data, preprocessed it, and applied multiple linear regression to model the relationship. I carefully interpreted the results and drew meaningful conclusions based on statistical significance and the summary of my model's input.\nOverall, my proficiency in linear regression is based on a combination of theoretical knowledge gained through coursework, practical application in projects and assignments, and the ability to critically analyze and interpret the results obtained.\n\n\n\n\nAware Areas:\nI marked these items as aware because I am familiar with the terms,  but have limited practice applying the techniques.\n\nData Feminism:\n\nMy awareness here derives from a combination of the literature and media I consume, along with principles discussed in PSM 650 – \"Ethical and professionalism\" and CIS 63– \"Data Mining\".\nI'd like to note that I bought the audiobook version of Data Feminism over Memorial Day. I am finding it easier to digest the philosophy presented in that format. \n\nClassification:\n\nI am familiar with the terms in classification and the types of ways we can categorize data as ordinal, nominal and categorical. I've used K-nearest neighbors algorithms, and decision trees in CIS 500 – \"Fundamentals of Software Practice.\"  I recognize I need to more exposure and practice here.\n\nLinear Model Selection and Regularization:\n\nLooking over the section titles of this ISL chapter, I see I have had some practice with dimension reduction using principle component analysis but have not taken the opportunity to apply this methodology outside of a lab exercise.\nAdditionally, as part of your Stat 518 – Statistical Computing and Graphics with R, I deployed bootstrapping methodology in the final project.\n\nMultiple Testing:\n\nI have had exposure to these concepts both professionally, when communicating market research and survey results and academically, particularly in Stat 216. I feel most comfortable with hypothesis testing , understanding type 1 and type 2 errors, and evaluating and explaining p-values.\nI marked this one as aware verses proficient because I feel I need more reinforcement learning in this area."
