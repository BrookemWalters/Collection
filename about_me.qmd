# Bio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Brooke, and I help companies find the hidden stories living in their data. I am fascinated by digital anthropology, machine learning, and the latest developments in AI.

I've been fortunate enough to work in some impressive organizations, from Fortune 100 companies to non-profits of all sizes. Currently, I'm working in the healthcare sector while pursuing my master's in data science and analytics. Work is just one piece of the puzzle, and I believe it's crucial to find joy in what you do; for me, that's advanced analytics.
